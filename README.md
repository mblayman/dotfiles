## Manual stuff

This is my checklist for the things that I need to do manually
before I can get to my automation.

1. Remap caps lock to ctrl.
2. Install 1Password.
3. Install `git`.
4. Set an ssh key in GitHub.
5. Clone `dotfiles` from GitHub.
6. Run `bootstap.sh`.
7. (Linux) Open GNOME Terminal > Edit > Preferences > Profiles > Unnamed > Custom font > Choose your Nerd Font from the list.
